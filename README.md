### Enlighten Framework

Using pieces of Laravel, Symfony, Zend and other php libraries that have become today's standard, Enlighten is a framework that follows similar goals as other php frameworks, but operates internally in an entirely different way. I'm determined to make the syntax just as expressive and pretty as laravel's. 

### The Differentiators 
# Not based on typical MVC but on ADR pattern (Action-Domain-Response) because it more closely relates to the layers that are found in, and specific to, web applications. See here for more info: <a href="http://pmjones.io/adr/">ADR Pattern</a>.
# 100% built in support for:
    - PSR-4/composer/autoloaders
    - PSR-7 Message Standards
    - PSR-15 (proposed) Standard
    - Event-Sourcing & CQRS

This project is in development. Any and all help would be appreciated.
